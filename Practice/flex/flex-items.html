    <!-- flex-basis: -->
        <!-- The flex-basis property sets the initial size of a flex item along the main axis
             before it is distributed in the flex container.
        It defines the default size of an item before the remaining space is distributed.
        css
        If the value is set to auto, the item will be sized based on its content.

        flex-grow:
        The flex-grow property determines how much a flex item should grow relative to the other
         flex items when there is extra space along the main axis.
        It is a unitless number that represents the factor by which the item should grow.
        css
        For example, if two items have flex-grow: 1 and flex-grow: 2 respectively, the second item 
        will grow twice as much as the first item when there is extra space available.

        flex-shrink:

        The flex-shrink property determines how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other 
        flex items when there is insufficient space along the main axis.
        It is a unitless number that represents the factor by which the item should shrink.
        css
        If an item has flex-shrink: 0, it won't shrink, and if it's set to a positive number, it will
         shrink proportionally to the other items.

        Here's an example that combines these properties:
        In this example, flex: 1 1 100px; is a shorthand for setting flex-grow, flex-shrink, and 
        flex-basis in a single property. The first value is flex-grow, the second is flex-shrink, and the third is flex-basis. -->
